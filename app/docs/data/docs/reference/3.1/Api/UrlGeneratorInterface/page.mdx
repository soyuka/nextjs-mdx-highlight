# [ApiPlatform\Api\UrlGeneratorInterface](/docs/v3.1/reference/Api/UrlGeneratorInterface)

UrlGeneratorInterface is the interface that all URL generator classes must implement.

This interface has been imported and adapted from the Symfony project.

The constants in this interface define the different types of resource references that
are declared in RFC 3986: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
We are using the term "URL" instead of "URI" as this is more common in web applications
and we do not need to distinguish them as the difference is mostly semantical and
less technical. Generating URIs, i.e. representation-independent resource identifiers,
is also possible.


```php
interface ApiPlatform\Api\UrlGeneratorInterface
{
    public generate(string $name, array $parameters, int $referenceType): string
}
```
## Methods

### generate

Generates a URL or path for a specific route based on the given parameters.Parameters that reference placeholders in the route pattern will substitute them in the
path or host. Extra params are added as query string to the URL.When the passed reference type cannot be generated for the route because it requires a different
host or scheme than the current one, the method will return a more comprehensive reference
that includes the required params. For example, when you call this method with $referenceType = ABSOLUTE_PATH
but the route requires the https scheme whereas the current scheme is http, it will instead return an
ABSOLUTE_URL with the https scheme and the current host. This makes sure the generated URL matches
the route in any case.If there is no route with the given name, the generator must throw the RouteNotFoundException.The special parameter _fragment will be used as the document fragment suffixed to the final URL.

```php
public generate(string $name, array $parameters, int $referenceType): string
```
